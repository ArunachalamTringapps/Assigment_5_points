# BasicPoints
Assigment 5 points in java
5. Design a class for a basic point in 2D space. The class should have the following features:
    - Instance variables for the x and y coordinates of the point.
    - A constructor that allows the user to create a point with given x and y coordinates.
    - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a point with the same x and y coordinates, and false otherwise.
    - A clone method that creates and returns a new point with the same x and y coordinates as the original point.
